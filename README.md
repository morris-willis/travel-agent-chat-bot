This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
This is a Project created for the synoptic assesment for my level 3 software technician apprenticeship
The chatbot asks 2 questions, and then display a page of results based on those questions. the code contains further comments on individual components functionality.
It is purely intended as a prototype, and lacks functionality that would be desired in production, such as a logging function for times when the bot is confused and resorts to its default response.
